# Fix for SecretaryPatientView.jsx

The issue with the `SecretaryPatientView.jsx` file is a syntax error at the end of the component. The return statement is missing a semicolon after the closing parenthesis.

## Current code (line 706-707):
```jsx
  )
}
```

## Fixed code (line 706-707):
```jsx
  );
}
```

This is a common syntax error in React components. The return statement in a functional component should end with a closing parenthesis followed by a semicolon.

## Steps to fix:

1. Open the file `frontend/src/components/SecretaryPatientView.jsx`
2. Go to line 706 (end of the return statement)
3. Change `)` to `);`
4. Save the file

This small change will fix the syntax error and allow the component to compile and render correctly.
