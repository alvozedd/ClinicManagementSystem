# Login Issue Fix Instructions

## Problem Diagnosis

The login issue is occurring because:

1. The backend API URL in the frontend configuration is pointing to a Railway deployment that is no longer accessible
2. The 404 error indicates that the backend server is not running or the URL has changed

## Solution Steps

### 1. Test the Login Functionality Locally

First, let's make sure the login functionality works locally:

```bash
# Start the test server
node testLoginLocally.js

# In another terminal, open the test login page
# On Windows:
start testLoginFrontend.html
# On Mac:
open testLoginFrontend.html
# On Linux:
xdg-open testLoginFrontend.html
```

### 2. Redeploy the Backend

#### Option 1: Redeploy to Railway

1. Log in to your Railway account
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the following environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://clinic_admin:adminMuchai123@cluster0.jrm4jes.mongodb.net/clinic_management?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
   - `JWT_SECRET`: `UroHealthSecureJWTSecret2024`
   - `PORT`: `5000`
5. Deploy the project
6. Note the new URL of your Railway deployment

#### Option 2: Deploy to Render.com

1. Sign up for a Render.com account
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - Name: `urohealth-backend`
   - Environment: `Node`
   - Build Command: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Start Command: `cd backend && node seedProduction.js && node server.js`
5. Set the following environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://clinic_admin:adminMuchai123@cluster0.jrm4jes.mongodb.net/clinic_management?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
   - `JWT_SECRET`: `UroHealthSecureJWTSecret2024`
   - `PORT`: `5000`
6. Deploy the service
7. Note the URL of your Render deployment (e.g., `https://urohealth-backend.onrender.com`)

### 3. Update the Frontend Configuration

1. Update the `.env.production` file with the new backend URL:

```
# Production API URL for backend deployment
VITE_API_URL=https://your-new-backend-url/api
```

2. Redeploy the frontend to Netlify:

```bash
# Build the frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (if you have the Netlify CLI installed)
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 4. Update CORS Settings

The backend CORS settings have been updated to include all possible Netlify domains, but if you're using a different domain, make sure to add it to the CORS configuration in `backend/server.js`.

### 5. Test the Login Functionality

1. Open your Netlify site in a browser
2. Try to log in with the following credentials:
   - Username: `admin@urohealth.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

## Security Considerations

1. After confirming that everything works, consider changing the default passwords in the production database
2. Update the JWT secret to a more secure value
3. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in the codebase

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the backend API is accessible by visiting the root URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-url/`)
3. Check the CORS settings in the backend to make sure your frontend domain is allowed
4. Verify that the MongoDB Atlas database is accessible
5. Check the Railway or Render logs for any error messages
