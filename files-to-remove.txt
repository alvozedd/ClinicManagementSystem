# Files to Remove

## Duplicate Frontend Directory
- The entire `frontend/` directory can be removed as we're using `new-frontend/` for the latest code

## Duplicate Components
- `new-frontend/src/AdminDashboard.jsx` (duplicate of `new-frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- `new-frontend/src/Dashboard.jsx` (should be refactored to use role-specific dashboards)

## Unused Backend Files
- `backend/config/db-memory.js` (we're using the local MongoDB configuration)

## Refactoring Notes
1. The backend server.js has been updated to use the local MongoDB configuration
2. The .env file has been updated to use a local MongoDB instance
3. The App.jsx has been refactored to use the separate LoginForm component
4. The LoginForm component has been fixed to prevent page refresh issues

## Next Steps
1. Rename `new-frontend/` to `frontend/` after removing the old frontend directory
2. Consolidate dashboard components into a single implementation per role
3. Simplify the patient management interface
4. Update the database seeder to work with the local MongoDB instance
