# Test Findings - Clinic Management System

This document outlines the issues found during testing of the Clinic Management System. The problems are grouped into categories to facilitate a systematic approach to fixing them.

## Group 1: Patient Deletion and Data Cascade Issues

- **Patient Deletion Cascade**: When a patient is deleted, all associated data (appointments, diagnoses, patient info) should be deleted, but this is not happening correctly.
  - Current implementation only removes appointments from local state but not from the database
  - No cascade deletion for diagnoses and other patient-related data

## Group 2: Data Refresh and UI Update Issues

- **Slow/Incomplete Data Refresh**: The refresh functionality is working slowly and sometimes requires a page reload.
  - When clicking the refresh button, data is not immediately updated in the UI
  - Need to reload the page to see changes

- **Patient Data Update Display**: When editing patient data and clicking save, the updated data is not immediately displayed although it's updated in the database.
  - Previous data still shows until you click edit again
  - The update is saved to the database but not reflected in the UI

- **Appointment CRUD Operations**: Appointments are being created, updated, and deleted slowly.
  - Changes to appointments are not immediately reflected in the UI
  - When adding an appointment for today, it's not updated until page reload

## Group 3: Date and Year of Birth Issues

- **Year of Birth Default**: The year by default goes to 2001 and when trying to remove it, it forcefully returns to 2001.
  - Cannot clear the year field
  - Default value is hardcoded to 2001

## Group 4: Appointment Sorting and Display Issues (RESOLVED)

- **Today's Appointments Sorting**: ✅ FIXED - Appointments are now properly sorted by date and time.
  - Implemented proper sorting by date first, then by time
  - Added consistent sorting across all appointment displays

- **Appointment History vs. Upcoming**: ✅ FIXED - Future appointments now appear in a separate "Upcoming Appointments" section.
  - Added separate sections for upcoming and previous appointments
  - Implemented proper date-based filtering to distinguish between past and future appointments

- **Appointment Time Management**: ✅ FIXED - Added time period filters for appointments.
  - Implemented filters for "Today", "Tomorrow", "This Week", "Next Week", "This Month"
  - Added utility functions to support time-based filtering

## Group 5: Diagnosis Workflow Issues (RESOLVED)

- **Pending Diagnosis Trigger**: ✅ FIXED - Pending diagnosis is now automatically triggered when an appointment time has passed and no diagnosis was added.
  - Implemented automatic status change for appointments without diagnoses
  - Added utility functions to identify and update appointments that need diagnoses

- **Pending Diagnosis Grouping**: ✅ FIXED - Pending diagnoses are now grouped together and clickable from a dedicated section.
  - Added a dedicated UI section for pending diagnoses in the doctor dashboard
  - Implemented easy identification of appointments that need diagnoses
  - Added quick access buttons to add diagnoses directly from this section

## Next Steps

1. Address each group of issues one by one, starting with the most critical (Group 1 - Patient Deletion)
2. Implement and test solutions for each group
3. Document the changes made and verify that the issues are resolved

**Note**: This document will be updated as issues are resolved and new issues are discovered.
