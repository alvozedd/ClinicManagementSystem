# Fix for SecretaryPatientView.jsx

The issue with the `SecretaryPatientView.jsx` file is a syntax error at the end of the component. The return statement is missing a semicolon after the closing parenthesis.

## Current code (line 706-707):
```jsx
  )
}
```

## Fixed code (line 706-707):
```jsx
  );
}
```

This is a common syntax error in React components. The return statement in a functional component should end with a closing parenthesis followed by a semicolon.

## Steps to fix:

1. Open the file `frontend/src/components/SecretaryPatientView.jsx`
2. Go to line 706 (end of the return statement)
3. Change `)` to `);`
4. Save the file

This small change will fix the syntax error and allow the component to compile and render correctly.

## Verification:

1. After making the change, check for any syntax errors or warnings in the IDE
2. Run the application to ensure the SecretaryPatientView component renders correctly
3. Test the functionality of the component to make sure everything works as expected

## Additional Notes:

Missing semicolons are a common source of syntax errors in JavaScript and React. While JavaScript has automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), it's good practice to explicitly include semicolons at the end of statements to avoid potential issues.
