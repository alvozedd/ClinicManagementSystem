# Clinic Management System - Problems to Solve

## Patient Management Issues

1. **Appointments Not Showing for Each Patient**
   - Appointments are not being displayed in the patient management section
   - Need to verify data flow and rendering of appointments

2. **Patient Editing and Deletion Permissions**
   - Need to verify if doctors and secretaries can properly edit and delete patients
   - Ensure permissions are correctly implemented

3. **Secretary Patient Management Issues**
   - Secretary patient management tab doesn't display search functionality like the doctor view
   - It appears to be stuck on one patient's information
   - Secretary needs time sorting just like for the doctor

## Diagnosis Functionality

1. **Missing Diagnosis Functionality for Doctor**
   - Diagnosis functionality for doctors seems to have been removed
   - Diagnosis should have its own tab

## Patient Attribution Issues

1. **Incorrect Attribution of Patient Addition**
   - When a secretary adds a patient, it's showing "added by doctor"
   - When a visitor books, it's showing "added by doctor"
   - When a visitor books in the dashboard, it's showing "not specified"

## UI/UX Issues

1. **Booking Page Issues**
   - Remove "UroHealth Central Ltd" second mention in booking page to increase space
   - Move location field to after contacts

2. **Navbar Issues**
   - Remove the lab icon in front of UroHealth in navbar title (makes the company look less professional)
   - When scrolling up, a white space is formed between the navbar and blue section

3. **Contact Section**
   - Center the contact information
